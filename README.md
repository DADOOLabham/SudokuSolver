# SudokuSolver
 Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle, where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9. The grid is divided into nine 3x3 subgrids, known as "regions," "boxes," or "blocks." The puzzle starts with some of the cells already filled in, and the goal is to fill in the empty cells such that:

Each row contains the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.
Each column contains the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.
Each 3x3 subgrid contains the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.

Backtracking Algorithm:
This is the most common method used in Sudoku solvers. It involves filling in numbers one by one and checking whether they violate any of the Sudoku rules. If a violation occurs, the algorithm backtracks, changing the previous number and trying a different value.
